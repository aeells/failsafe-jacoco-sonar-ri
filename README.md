# jacoco-sonar-ri
Maven failsafe plugin, Jacoco code coverage and Sonar reference implementation.

It is often tricky to retro-fit Jacoco code coverage into an existing multi-module maven project, 
this reference implementation might make it clearer what is required. 

<em>All of the required configuration is in the system-under-test maven modules' [pom.xml](system-under-test/pom.xml) file for reference.</em>
